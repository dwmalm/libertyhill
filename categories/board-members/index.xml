      <description>Dear Liberty Hill Residents, I would like to introduce myself to you and tell you a little bit about me.
I was born and raised in Solon and have lived here for over 50 years, 24 in Liberty Hill. My parents moved to Solon in 1949. I have been married to Maribeth for 41 years, have 2 adult children and 4 grandchildren. My children went through Solon schools. I have served on the Solon Recreation Commission and on the Grantwood Board.</description>
