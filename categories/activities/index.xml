      <description>Those of you who frequent the park know the playground equipment has desperately needed a new coat of paint! Our Treasurer Dave kindly donated the paint and with the help of some great volunteers we were able to paint all of the metal equipment and fix the broken swings in just a few hours!
Thanks again to our terrific group of volunteers and to the HOA members who made this possible!</description>
