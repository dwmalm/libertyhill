      <description>The garage sale this year was a great success! We had 19 houses in the sale this year and hundreds of customers came to shop, generating thousands of dollars in sales!
Thank you to everyone who participated in the sale, if you did well please encourage your neighbors to participate next year! Big thanks to our new secretary Mackenzie Hester for organizing the sale and all those who assisted in the event, including Joanna Innes and Tim Stacey.</description>

      <description>Those of you who frequent the park know the playground equipment has desperately needed a new coat of paint! Our Treasurer Dave kindly donated the paint and with the help of some great volunteers we were able to paint all of the metal equipment and fix the broken swings in just a few hours!
Thanks again to our terrific group of volunteers and to the HOA members who made this possible!</description>
