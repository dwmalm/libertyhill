Those of you who frequent the park know the playground equipment has desperately
needed a new coat of paint! Our Treasurer Dave kindly donated the paint and
with the help of some great volunteers we were able to paint all of the metal equipment
_and_ fix the broken swings in just a few hours!

Thanks again to our terrific group of volunteers and to the HOA members who made this
possible!
