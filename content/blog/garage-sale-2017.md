The garage sale this year was a great success! We had 19 houses in the sale
this year and hundreds of customers came to shop, generating thousands of
dollars in sales!

Thank you to everyone who participated in the sale, if you
did well please encourage your neighbors to participate next year! Big thanks
to our new secretary Mackenzie Hester for organizing the sale and all those who
assisted in the event, including Joanna Innes and Tim Stacey.
