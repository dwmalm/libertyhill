Dear Liberty Hill Residents,
I would like to introduce myself to you and tell you a little bit about me.

I was born and raised in Solon and have lived here for over 50 years, 24 in
Liberty Hill. My parents moved to Solon in 1949. I have been married to
Maribeth for 41 years, have 2 adult children and 4 grandchildren. My children
went through Solon schools. I have served on the Solon Recreation Commission
and on the Grantwood Board.

I volunteered to take the position with the Liberty
Hill Homeowners Association because I enjoy getting involved in my community
and working to make it the best place to live in our great city.

My first task as President will be to figure out how to attract more residents
into becoming Liberty Hill HOA members. Looking forward to meeting and talking
to my Liberty Hill Neighbors.

Please donâ€™t hesitate to email or call me if you have a problem .

Sincerely, Tim
