The Service Department will begin the curbside leaf collection program on
Monday, October 15, 2018. The program will run through Friday, December 14,
2018 weather permitting. We ask that residents place their leaves _3 feet_ from
the curb. City crews will work their way around the city to collect them. Crews
will pass through each area several times throughout the collection season.

The Service Department requires that leaf piles NEVER be placed in the roadway;
this can cause an unsafe situation for motorists and block storm sewers which
will result in flooding issues. [City Ordinance (ORD. #1964-660.3)](http://library.amlegal.com/nxt/gateway.dll/Ohio/solon_oh/partsix-generaloffensescode/chapter660safetysanitationandhealth?f=templates$fn=default.htm$3.0$vid=amlegal:solon_oh$anc=JD_660.03) states the
following:

> (c) No person shall deposit any leaves within any public street or sidewalk except on the tree lawn between the sidewalk and the curb.

When placing leaves out for collection they should be raked into a windrow and
placed close to but not in the roadway. No brush, small branches or other
materials should be mixed in with leaf piles as this material will clog and
damage the leaf collection equipment and slow down the collection process.
Foreign objects can also be thrown from a machine and potentially harm a worker
or motorist.

You can help assist the Service Department by mulching your leaves while mowing
your lawn; this will add beneficial soil amendment to your lawn. Additionally,
small piles of leaves should be placed into brown craft yard waste bags
whenever possible and placed out for collection on your normal rubbish
collection day. An additional truck will pick the leaf bags up.

Due to the large volume of leaves that come down in a short period of time, no
daily schedule can be followed during leaf collection. The collection of leaves
will be made during several trips through the city. Please feel free to contact
the Service Department to inquire where city crews are currently collecting.
Once the leaf collection program has ended, all leaves must be placed into
brown craft yard waste bags and placed out for collection on your normal
rubbish collection day.

The Service Department would like to thank residents of Solon for their
continued cooperation and ask that you contact the Solon Service Department at
248-5834 for more information about the fall leaf collection program.

Leaves collected are composted, not put in a landfill.

Remember next spring we will generate compost and mulch that is available to
Solon Residents. Call us for pricing and availability in the spring of 2018.

If you have questions regarding the leaf collection process feel free to
contact Dennis Varga, Solid Waste Manager at (440) 248-5834
